                        <p>On one hot summer day, Grace was leaving her boyfriend’s house to go to the park. As she was walking out of the front yard, a group of men started shouting at her from a car parked nearby.</p>
                        <p>“Oh my God, you look so sexy, come get in the car.”</p>
                        <p>Grace continued walking, head down, her heart beating faster. She could feel she was already sweating.</p>
                        <p>She ignored the comments, which then turned into insults. Her mind was racing with thoughts of what could happen if the car followed her. She was on a side street, and it was quiet, and all she could do was walk as fast as she could.</p>
                        <p>“In the end the car wasn’t following me. But it was all going through my head, all the pieces, all the scenarios. It's just how we have been programmed to think ,” says Grace.</p>
                        <p>Experiences like these are why she and her friend  Sarah started campaigning against street harassment. And many women could relate to them, because they have experienced the same.</p>
                        <p>Personal safety is one of the most common issues that women raise when talking about their experiences of being alone in public. Women would recognise that what happened to Grace is concerning and scary. They would also recognise that the experience is not an isolated incident, because it has happened to many of them too.</p>
                        <p>There is not a detailed, conclusive definition of what street harassment is. And while the law, academia and media have been trying to come up with one, women can easily identify it as the inevitable reality of walking down the street as a woman.</p>
                        <p>In response to an anonymous survey about what street harassment is, women from Cardiff and the surrounding areas have shared their stories: the experiences that led them to be scared to walk alone in the neighbourhoods where they live and work.</p>
                    <h6>“I was 15”</h6>
                    <p>I remember very vividly the first time I was properly cat called, I was 15 and with my dad walking at night. A  large car of men drove past quickly, they then circled back and screamed out the window “show us your tits” and my dad was just embarrassed and angry.I was in shock but didn’t understand what had happened. We’ve never talked about it since.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“They kept shouting what they were going to do to me”</h3>
                    <p>The scariest story was when I was around 14, walking home from my grandparents house to mine, which is one street away. It was around 7pm in the winter and two men appeared behind me, and as I increased my pace they did too. They kept shouting at me, to get my attention, asking my name, asking where I was going, if they could join me; shouting what they were going to do to me when they caught up to me and commenting on the size of my breasts and bum. Thankfully I ran into the back garden of my house and a voice down the street shouted at them which got their attention for enough time to hide away. The men then carried on laughing past the house and walked down a very dark street towards a field still calling after me.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“He said that he often sees me walking alone and that he knows I live alone”</h3>
                    <p>Once a man followed me on the way home from the gym, asking me about my number, telling me that he had seen me many times and that he knows my address and where I work. He said that he often sees me walking alone and that he knows that I don't have a boyfriend and that I live alone. It scared me so much and I wanted to report it to the police but I was scared that he could come to my house or follow me after work. I have seen him a couple of times after when I was with my boyfriend and he didn't say anything or approach us,thank god.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“I was so scared what his intentions were”</h3>
                    <p>On one occasion a man followed me from my local supermarket to my home, at night, with my hands full of shopping bags and tried to make conversation with me about how he had seen me in the shop and thought I was cute. I was so scared of what his intentions were that I just froze and didn’t feel able to tell him to leave me alone for fear of what he might do but also of ‘getting it wrong’ and insulting him.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“A van of men pulled up next to me and asked me to get in”</h3>
                    <p>I have been harassed on the street many times. A car full or strangers videoing me when I was on a run. Being cat called outside my own house by men in a van while I cleaned my own house. When I was 13 walking back from school a van of men pulled up next to me and asked me to get in the van and that I was sexy and they needed to give me a lift.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“Two seconds after leaving the house we were harassed by three cars and vans”</h3>
                    <p>A group of friends (girls) and I were going out for drinks. Two seconds after leaving our house we were harassed by  three different cars/vans in a row. All with men in them, shouted at us out their windows. Had a guy in a van ( with other people and was sitting in the middle) lean out of the window to make a comment at me and my two friends. Had a guy on the other side of the road (at night) start to shout at me about paying for me or something along those lines</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“A gorup of drunk men grabbed at our wrists”</h3>
                    <p>One situation when I was younger- walking through town aged 20/21 on Halloween, a group of drunk men grabbed at our waists. Another situation a few years later was walking through another town in my home county (Cornwall) where a van driver beeped at me and shouted something out of his window I couldn't make out.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">“Objectified, Unsafe, Dirty””</h3>
                    <p>The first instance of street harassment that I can remember is from when I was twelve years old. I remember walking down the street and a car full of men leering and shouting at me as they drove past. But I don’t think that this was the first time it happened. It made me feel Objectified, Unsafe, Dirty.</p>
