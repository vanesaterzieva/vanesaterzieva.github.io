                       <p>Amber was 13 years old when she experienced street harassment for the first time. She was walking with a group of friends when a man made a sexual comment about her from the window of his car. “It confused me at the time but it also made me feel scared," says Amber.</p>
                       <p>Amber (not her real name) is not the only woman this has happened to. Four out of five women have experienced some sort of harassment by men in a public place. More than half of women over the age of 18 have been targeted with sexual comments and remarks in public places, or have had a man wolf whistle at them from the window of a car or a building.</p>
                       <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7438310"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                       <p>”I'm not sure if I know any women who haven't experienced street harassment,” says Amber.</p>
                       <p>But official numbers tell a different story. Only three percent of all the crimes recorded in England and Wales in the year ending December 2020 were sexual offences. Some of them might have been as a result of street harassment, but it is unclear how many. </p>
                       <p>Three percent is not a big number, at least certainly not big enough to count all the women who have been harassed in public places or have experienced sexual violence.But why does official data tell us that instances of street harassment and public sexual harassment happen very rarely compared to other crimes? </p>
                       <p>Street harassment is not a criminal offence in the UK, and people cannot be prosecuted by the law unless it is considered to be sexual harassment (of physical nature). </p>
                       <p>When a person catcalls a woman on the street, they won’t get in trouble with the law, because the law for street harassment does not exist. There is no official reporting procedure which recognises street harassment either, which prevents many girls and women from ever reporting it.</p>
                       <p>The lack of clarity in the law and ways  to report and record cases of street harassment results in the lack of data. Official sources do not have a special category for street harassment. If it is reported, depending on how severe it is, it can be included in the figures for sexual violence. </p>
                       <p>“Data wise, its very very difficult to depict street harassment if there's no Home office definition of crime, or that would allow the police to record that information, and it would probably come under anti social behaviour, ” says Jenny Rogers, Community Safety manager at Cardiff Council with 13 years of experience in South Wales Police. </p>
                       <p>“And that's where your data is going to be an issue to try and quantify what that looks like,” comments Rogers. </p>
                       <p>Not being able to record cases properly is not the only problem that the police face.Many girls and women do not feel supported by authorities and think that reporting it would not matter. </p>
                       <p>A participant in an online survey among people in Cardiff who have experienced street harassment says she felt like reporting street harassment was a “waste of time”. She thought that the police wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p>
                       <p>Similarly another participant says that the incident “didn’t seem big enough to bother sharing with the police.”</p>
                       <p>Others comment that often they don't have a name or “any real identifying information” </p>
                       <p>Ian Tumelty, a Crime Reduction Manager and former police officer at South Wales Police, thinks that the authorities would be able to take action if street harassment is reported. “It's constantly under the radar of the police.I think they could do something about it if they knew about it,” says Tumelty. </p>
                       <p>Many of those stories are left unheard: not only by the police, but by charities and sometimes even by victim’s  families. </p>
                       <p>“When it happens to me I tend to just ignore it and push past it, let it go and forget about it, because I know that my family or the police won’t take it seriously,” says a survey respondent.</p>
                       <p>This feeling of helplessness is common among young women who have been victims of street harassment. Experencing street harassment has also changed their percptions of personal safety in public places.</p>
                       <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7448841"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
                        <p>There are many reasons why their cases do not ever get reported to the police or any charities.</p>
                       <p>“Sometimes families tend to try and sort out the problem themselves or they may think it's a bit like drugs: not a problem or they want to deal with it in house rather than tell the police,” siad Tumelty. </p>
                       <p>In his career as a police officer he had been aware of occasions of street harassment. But he also knows from other people, from stories of colleagues or even his own daughters, that never got reported to the police. </p>
                       <p>“I was talking to some female colleagues, it seems as though the majority have had some form of harassment either growing up as teenagers or when going into university”</p>
                       <p>A problem that is not evidenced by concrete data is hard to quantify. And even though some data might be recorded by authorities, it takes much longer to analyse compared to other incidents.</p>
                       <p>“There are ways around that. When I've tried to get data, you could go in and read every single reported incident as it comes through from a 999 or 111 call. You could look at it and label it. It would be forever to decode some data,”says Jenny Rogers. </p>
                       <p>One solution will be to criminalize street harassment and start recording it as a crime. Whether women will be encouraged to report it more or whether it would make a difference in the number of incidents is unknown. But in countries like France, where catcalling and wolf whistling is illegal, twenty-nine percent of women say they have been sexually harassed by a man, a number that is two times lower than in the UK</p>
                       <p>There are many girls who want their voice to be heard. “I want to be able to report street harassment and know that it is going to be taken seriously,” says one of the survey respondents. But until the laws are in place to allow them to do that, their options are limited.</p>
